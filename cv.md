My **goal** is to get required knowledge and start a career as a Junior Front-End Developer. I am interested in this profession because it is dynamic and rapidly developing. This is a great opportunity to learn something new and interact with intelligent people. I have no experience as a programmer but I`m a fast-learner, well-organized and responsible worker. Positive, polite, cheerful and stubborn in achieving the final result.

I have basic skills in working with programming technologies such as:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git

#### Education

Graduated from Belarusian State University, Faculty of International Relations, Customs department in 2013.

#### Courses and Training

#### Code examples

```js
   function decode(expr) {
    let tempArray = []
    let counter = 0
    let word = ''
    for (let index = 0; index < expr.length; index += 2) {
        counter++
        const element = expr[index] + expr[index + 1];
        if (element === '10') {
            tempArray.push('.')
        }
        if (element === '11') {
            tempArray.push('-')
        }
        if (counter === 5) {
            word += MORSE_TABLE[tempArray.join('')] || ' '
            tempArray = []
            counter = 0
        }
    }
       return word
    }
```

#### English

I have an intermediate level of **English**. Now I work as an import specialist so I constantly interact with foreign suppliers, prepare documents in English.
